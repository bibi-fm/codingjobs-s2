Continue the MVC Example about Songs.

Step 1 : 
    - Create an ArtistModel and add a method to insert an Artist
    This method is taking four(4) arguments : name, gender, birth_year and bio.

    - Method should return true or false. 

Step 2 : 
    - Create a view NewArtistView, that displays a form to insert a new Song.


Step 3 : 
    - Create ArtistController and add a method to handle displaying the form
    This method should require the view to display the form

Step 4 :
    Edit index.php file to handle request to show the form for adding new artist

Step 5 : 
    - Edit ArtistController and add a method to handle inserting a Song
