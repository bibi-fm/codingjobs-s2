    (b) In this page, display all the informations about the user : username / email and picture
    (c) Create a 'Delete' button/link. When you click, it should :
        (c.1) Delete the user from the DB
        (c.2) Redirect to register page

    --Bonus--

    Make a small form with an input type file + submit button on the page.
    This form will allow the user to change its profile picture.

    When the user select a picture and press 'upload', it should upload the file and UPDATE the DB.
